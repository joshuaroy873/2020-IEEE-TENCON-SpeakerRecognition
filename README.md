# 2020-IEEE-TENCON-SpeakerRecognition

Dataset for text‑independent speaker recognition (47 speakers). Each recording is ~3–5 seconds.

## Dataset
- Total speakers: 47
- Recordings per speaker: multiple short utterances (3–5 s each)
- Utterance types:
  - Same Utterance 1: "Library Access"
  - Same Utterance 2: "Library Access"
  - Different Utterance: random words (speaker-specific)
- Recording conditions: different devices, environments and locations across India. Care taken to avoid devices with built‑in noise reduction.
